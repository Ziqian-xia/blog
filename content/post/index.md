When I received the message that the review stage for my paper is finished, I feel much relieved. Major Revisions, at least, better than Reject. After two rows of revisions, my supervisor, Prof Tian is still not content with my paper and he points out that it needs substantial improvement in Discussion Section. For the next few days, I will update some reviews which contain my personal views towards previous studies, and I try to find a cozy, comfortable way to structure papers.

## A Review to *From intention to action: How do personal attitudes, facilities accessibility, and government stimulus matter for household waste sorting?* *Journal of Environmental Management*

For easy reading propose, you can download this paper when reading this post.

Zhang, B., Lai, K. H., Wang, B., & Wang, Z. (2019). From intention to action: How do personal attitudes, facilities accessibility, and government stimulus matter for household waste sorting?. Journal of environmental management, 233, 447-458.

### ABSTRACT

- **Question**: There is a notable discrepancy between intention on household waste sorting and the actions taken to support this environmental initiative among residents in China.
- **Aim of the study**: This study aims to explore the influences of personal attitudes, facilities accessibility, and government stimulus on this discrepancy.
- **Methods**: Built on .... among Chinese residents.
- **Results**:: Main result count for 2/5 of the abstract, while additional results counts for 1/5 
- **Meaning**: One general sentence

### Findings Summary

1. Discrepancy exists
2. Facilities accessibility and government stimulus weaken discrepancy (By which mean?)
3. Facilities accessibility and government stimulus do not moderate the intention-behaviour relationship
4. Personal norm sig, Subjective norms and perceived behavioural control insig.

### Main text

#### Intro

*Note that numbers below stands for subsections in each sections.* 

1. 3 sentences, macro-level background, display Data. Waste Produced
2. China level, introduce waste sorting.
3. Introduce problem: How to promote household waste sorting is important for source separation of waste.
4. A short general literature Review, turning to unsolved dilemmaï¼šHowever, most of the aforementioned studies do not pay special attention to the discrepancy between behavioral intention and actual behavior around waste sorting. Introduce its importance.
5. A long Literature Review for this dilemma and comparison.

2. Path coeffient reports of three models and confirmations of hypotheses.

#### Discussions

1. Interpret results of existing discrepancy
2. Possible reasons 
3. Findings differ from previous studies
