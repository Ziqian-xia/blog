### Environmental Psychology: History, Scope, and Methods

Highlight

-   环境心理学的定义

-   环境心理学范围的历史发展

-   当前领域主要的研究方法

#### 环境心理学的定义

"人与自然的交互、人对自然的影响与促进亲环境行为"

> We define environmental psychology as the discipline that studies the interplay between individuals and the built and natural environment. This means that environmental psychology examines the influence of the environment on human experiences, behaviour, and well‐being, as well as the influence of individuals on the environment, that is, factors influencing environmental behaviour, and ways to encourage pro‐environmental behaviour.

#### 环境心理学发展历史

起源：1960s

-   早期：建筑环境与心理学(物理环境)

    > In this early period of the field of environmental psychology, much attention was given to the built physical environment (i.e. architecture, technology, and engineering)

-   第二个阶段：绿色心理学

    > The second period of rapid growth in environmental psychology started during the late 1960s when people increasingly became aware of environmental problems. This resulted in studies on sustainability issues, that is, studies on explaining and changing environmental behaviour to create a healthy and sustainable environment.

-   当前阶段: 应对气候变化

    环境心理学的一个持续且不断增长的关注点是找到改变人们行为的方法来扭转环境问题，同时维护人类的福祉和生活质量。

    -   人类-环境交互视角

        -   环境对人类的影响(Well-being)

            > The negative as well as positive influences of environmental conditions on humans, with a focus on environmental impacts on human health and well‐being.

        -   人类对环境的影响(Environmental Quality)

            > Factors that influence human behaviour that affect environmental quality, with a focus on pro‐environmental behaviour.

        -   提高亲环境行为(Promoting pro-environmental behaviour)

            > Factors affect the outcomes and acceptability of strategies to encourage pro‐environmental behaviour for creating sustainable environments.

    -   学科交叉视角

        -   地理与建筑学：环境表征

        -   认知科学：亲环境行为理论发展

        -   环境科学：行为的环境影响

    -   基于现实问题

        > The problems and associated solutions that are studied vary across these levels. For example, at the local level, problems like littering and solutions like recycling may be a focus of research. At regional and national levels, problems like species loss and solutions like ecological restoration can be studied. At the global level, problems like climate change and solutions like the adoption of new technologies to combat climate change are of interest. Environmental psychology is concerned with problems at all scales, from local to global.

#### 研究方法

Validity的取舍：

> Choosing a method typically involves a trade‐off between internal and external validity. Internal validity reflects the extent to which cause--effect relationships can be established. External validity reflects the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other populations or settings.
