### Abstract
- **Question**: Waste sorting is essential to address the current predicament of waste management. Though it is important, insufficient attention has been paid to explore residents’ waste sorting intention and behavior and understand its formation process.
- **Aim**:To narrow the research gap, this research built...to explicate residents’ waste sorting intention and behavior formation process...explored the effect of external conditions, such as incentive measures, on this discrepancy.
- **Result**: Factors* were directly and significantly related to residents’ waste sorting intention, the link between intention and behavior was contingent on incentive measures. 
- **Meaning**: This research is useful for understanding residents’ waste sorting inten- tion and behavior and valuable for encouraging residents to sort waste in their daily lives.
