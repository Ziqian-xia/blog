### Computational Social in Climate Change Perception: A Research Plan

-   Does Abnormal Weather Increase Climate Change Perception and Adaptation behavior in Chinese?

#### Method

Scrapping and text analysis of social media in abnormal weather situation.

Topic Modelling

Sentiment Analysis (Manual Coding and Machine Learning Classifers)

Text Similarity

Abnormal Weather Data(Searching Index;NOAA Weather;)

#### Key Ref

1.  Global climate marches sharply raise attention to climate change: Analysis of climate search behavior in 46 countries
2.  Variation of public discourse about the impacts of fracking with geographic scale and proximity to proposed development

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Survey study of CCUS/Climate Change Adaptation or Mitigation Behavior

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Developing pre-intervention scales of pro-environmental behavior

#### Key Problem

$$
F(Personal Predictors,EnvirPredictor,...)=TargetIntervetion
$$

$$
While: Predictors → Intervention → Effectsizes
$$

That is, using categorical variables to predict categorical variable by literature screening.

#### Method

1.  Review key influences and its target behavior change
2.  **Set up numerical or categorical relationships between personal**
3.  **characteristics and suitable intervention method**
4.  Test the effective
5.  Building Shiny APP or Scale Wrapper

### Large Scale Pre-registered Field Intervention in Pro-environment behavior

### Crowding out effect in climate change adaptation behavior
