Hi there, I am Ziqian Xia, an undergraduate student at [Nanchang University](https://www.ncu.edu.cn) as well as a primary researcher at [Xi tian's group](http://sem.ncu.edu.cn/szdw/szgk/js/79c83e7575f34bfca134a33cd2e17209.htm).

*Note that from June 2021 to Sep 2021, I am a research assistant in [University of Winnipeg](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/), for related research, please contact me via **z.xia-ra@uwinnipeg.ca**.*

- I am interested in research on environmental behavior and environmental economics. Currently I am trying to measure pro-environmental behavior using IoT data. See [my research section](#featured) for detail.

- I am a fan of [R](https://www.rstudio.com) and I enjoy using it for modeling and visualization. I am currently working on a visualization package that help figures easily meets the publication requirements. 

**I will join [Chao Zhang's Group](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/12413.html) in [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) next year.**
