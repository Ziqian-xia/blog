Hi there, I am Ziqian Xia, a graduate student at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) as well as a primary researcher at [Chao Zhang's Group](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/12413.html) and [Cambridge Collective Intelligence & Design Group](https://camcid.github.io/).

- I am interested in research on the human and policy dimensions of climate change. Currently I am trying to understand climate change mitigation / adaptation behavior using IoT-based and remote sensing techniques. See [my full publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dyNjCrIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for detail.

- I am using MRP and MIRO to conduct large-scale surveys of Chinese individuals, estimating their climate change perceptions and individual carbon footprint. See [China Climate Communication Initiative](https://climcomm.netlify.app/) for detail.

I had my academic training at [Xi Tian's Group](http://sem.ncu.edu.cn/szdw/gccrc/gccrcjxssqjhljrc/799a668ea7be430c9edb199b04109392.htm) under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Xi Tian](http://sem.ncu.edu.cn/szdw/gccrc/gccrcjxssqjhljrc/799a668ea7be430c9edb199b04109392.htm) and [Bits to Energy lab](https://www.digitaltransformation.rw.fau.eu/) at FAU Germany, under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Verena Tiefenbeck](https://www.wiso.rw.fau.de/forschung/forschungsprofil/professorenschaft/prof-dr-verena-tiefenbeck/).

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position, please feel free to contact me.**
